## Key Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Utilizes the pre-trained **DialoGPT** model for natural and coherent responses.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates emotional tone for each message, tracking mood and adapting responses.
- **Modern UI**: A responsive, user-friendly interface optimized for desktop and mobile.
- **Real-Time Responses**: Ensures instant feedback via a Flask server.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Backend framework for handling API requests and real-time interactions.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Integrates the **DialoGPT** model for conversational AI.
- **PyTorch**: Supports deep learning processes for the chatbot.
- **NLP**: Powers both response generation and sentiment analysis.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Builds a sleek and intuitive user interface.
